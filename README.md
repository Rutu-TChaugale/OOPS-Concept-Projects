# 🚀 OOPS Concept Projects

## 📌 About
The **💡 OOPS Concept Projects** repository is a collection of Java-based projects designed to illustrate and enhance understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. These projects cover key OOP concepts such as **inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and interfaces**, providing hands-on implementations for effective learning. 🎯

## 🔥 Projects Overview

🔹 **🧑‍🎓 ersonManager (Inheritance)** – Demonstrates inheritance by managing different types of persons (e.g., students, teachers). 👨‍🏫

🔹 **📦 InventoryManager (Inheritance)** – Implements inheritance to efficiently manage inventory, showcasing parent-child relationships in classes. 🏪

🔹 **🚗 VehicleManagementSystem (Polymorphism)** – Utilizes polymorphism to handle various vehicle types dynamically. 🏍️🚙

🔹 **💳 PaymentManagementSystem (Interfaces)** – Demonstrates abstraction via interfaces to manage multiple payment methods securely. 💰

🔹 **🎓 HAS-A Relationship Student** – Explores composition (**HAS-A relationship**) by structuring students with associated attributes and behaviors. 🏫

🔹 **🏦 Encapsulation-Bank Management System** – Implements **encapsulation** for secure and controlled access to bank account data. 🔐
