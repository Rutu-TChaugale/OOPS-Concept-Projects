# 🚀 OOP Concepts Project Repository  

## 📌 Introduction  
Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Project Repository!** 🎯  

This repository contains multiple real-world projects demonstrating **fundamental OOP principles**. Each project is carefully designed to implement one or more core concepts such as **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces, and Has-a Relationships.**  

Whether you're a **beginner learning OOP** or an **experienced developer revisiting key concepts**, this repository will serve as a valuable reference.

## 🏆 Projects Overview  

Each project is focused on a specific **OOP concept** and applies it to a real-world scenario. Below is a breakdown of all the projects:  

---

### 🔹 1. **Bank Management System** – *Encapsulation*  
💡 **Concept:** Encapsulation ensures **data hiding** by restricting direct access to class members and exposing only necessary functionalities via methods.  

📌 **Key Features:**  
✔ Secure **account management** using private data members.  
✔ **Getter and setter methods** to access and modify account details safely.  
✔ Functionalities:  
   - 🏦 **Create a new bank account**  
   - 💰 **Deposit & Withdraw money**  
   - 📊 **Check account balance**  

🛠 **Implementation Highlights:**  
- Uses **private variables** for account details.  
- Implements **public methods** to modify and retrieve data securely.  

---

### 🔹 2. **Student Management System** – *Has-a Relationship (Composition)*  
💡 **Concept:** The **"Has-a" relationship (Composition)** is demonstrated by associating a student with multiple courses and subjects.  

📌 **Key Features:**  
✔ **Student records management** including name, ID, and grades.  
✔ **Course registration and subject tracking** using object references.  
✔ Functionalities:  
   - 🎓 **Enroll students in courses**  
   - 📚 **Assign subjects to students**  
   - 🏆 **Calculate and display grades**  

🛠 **Implementation Highlights:**  
- A **Student class** contains references to multiple **Course objects** (Has-a relationship).  
- Encapsulates **student details and academic data** in well-defined classes.  

---

### 🔹 3. **Payment Management System** – *Interface Implementation*  
💡 **Concept:** Interfaces define a **common structure** for multiple payment methods, ensuring flexibility and scalability.  

📌 **Key Features:**  
✔ Implements a **Payment Interface** for different payment gateways.  
✔ **Supports multiple payment methods**:  
   - 💳 **Credit/Debit Card Payments**  
   - 💸 **UPI Transactions**  
   - 🌐 **PayPal Integration**  
✔ **Transaction history and security validations**  

🛠 **Implementation Highlights:**  
- The **Payment interface** defines standard methods like `processPayment()` and `validateTransaction()`.  
- Concrete classes (`CreditCardPayment`, `UPIPayment`, etc.) **implement the interface** uniquely.  

---

### 🔹 4. **Vehicle Management System** – *Polymorphism*  
💡 **Concept:** Polymorphism enables **method overriding**, allowing different vehicle types to have unique behaviors.  

📌 **Key Features:**  
✔ **Different vehicle types** (`Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`) inheriting from a common `Vehicle` class.  
✔ **Each vehicle type overrides common methods** such as:  
   - 🚗 **start()** – Different startup mechanisms.  
   - ⛽ **fuelConsumption()** – Varies by vehicle type.  
✔ **Dynamic method dispatch** ensures correct method execution at runtime.  

🛠 **Implementation Highlights:**  
- The `Vehicle` class has common methods like `start()`, `stop()`, and `fuelConsumption()`.  
- Each subclass (`Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`) **overrides** these methods with specific implementations.  

---

### 🔹 5. **Inventory & Person Manager** – *Inheritance*  
💡 **Concept:** Inheritance allows a **child class to inherit properties and behaviors** from a parent class, promoting **code reuse and hierarchy.**  

📌 **Key Features:**  
✔ **Person hierarchy** with common attributes like `name`, `age`, and `address`.  
✔ **Specialized classes for employees, customers, and suppliers.**  
✔ **Inventory tracking system** using parent-child class structure.  

🛠 **Implementation Highlights:**  
- `Person` (Base Class) ➝ `Employee`, `Customer`, `Supplier` (Derived Classes).  
- The `Inventory` system extends base functionalities using **inheritance principles**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
✔ **Programming Language:** Java (or specify if different)  
✔ **IDE Used:** Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code  
✔ **Database (if any):** MySQL / SQLite (Mention if applicable)
